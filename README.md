**Abstract**

Replicating Levine, McKnight, and Heep (2011), I assess the impact of public policy on the health insurance coverage rates of teenagers and young adults.
I examine two policy efforts, the expansion of Medicaid by states to low-income teenagers following the introduction of SCHIP in 1997 and individual efforts by
states allowing young adults aged 19 - 24 to remain on their parent’s health insurance. I take use of a discontinuity at age 19 to examine the impact of SCHIP
and quasi-experimental variation between states to measure the impact of extended parental coverage laws. My analysis shows that both SCHIP and extended parental
coverage laws have been moderately successful in improving health insurance coverage for teenagers and young adults. However, significant violation of pre-trend
testing may call into question the original work’s estimations.
